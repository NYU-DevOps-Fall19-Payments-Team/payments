# lab-flask-rest

NYU DevOps lab showing a very simple REST API all on one Python module `app.py`

## Introduction

This lab demonstrates how to create a simple REST service using Python Flask and SQLite.
The resource model is persistenced using SQLAlchemy to keep the application simple. SQLAlchemy is an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) that will allow you to work with classes instead of database records.

This projects purpose is to show the correct API and return codes that should be used for a REST API. Everything is contained ina single

## Prerequisite Installation using Vagrant VM

The easiest way to use this lab is with **Vagrant** and **VirtualBox**. if you don't have this software the first step is down download and install it.

Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)

Then all you have to do is clone this repo and invoke vagrant:

```bash
    git clone https://github.com/nyu-devops/lab-flask-rest.git
    cd lab-flask-rest
    vagrant up
    vagrant ssh
    cd /vagrant
    FLASK_APP=service:app flask run -h 0.0.0.0
```

## Alternate install using local Python

If you have Python 3 installed on your computer you can make a virtual environment and run the code locally with:

```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    FLASK_APP=service:app flask run
```

## Manually running the Tests

Run the tests using `nose`

```bash
    nosetests
```

**Nose** is configured to automatically include the flags `--with-spec --spec-color` so that red-green-refactor is meaningful. If you are in a command shell that supports colors, passing tests will be green while failing tests will be red. It also has `--with-coverage` specified so that code coverage is included in the tests.

The Code Coverage tool runs with `nosetests` so to see how well your test cases exercise your code just run the report:

```bash
    coverage report -m
```

This is particularly useful because it reports the line numbers for the code that is not covered so that you can write more test cases.

To run the service use `flask run` (Press Ctrl+C to exit):

```bash
    FLASK_APP=service:app flask run -h 0.0.0.0
```

You must pass the parameters `-h 0.0.0.0` to have it listed on all network adapters to that the post can be forwarded by `vagrant` to your host computer so that you can open the web page in a local browser at: http://localhost:5000

When you are done, you can exit and shut down the vm with:

```bash
    exit
    vagrant halt
```

If the VM is no longer needed you can remove it with:

```bash
    vagrant destroy
```
